# Leet-ListNode Workspace

This is a simple, light-weight project is created to help with LeetCode's ListNode problem.

LeetCode is an online platform for preparing coding interview questions,
However, as non-premium user doesn't have access to debuggers, a local leet code workspace would be helpful to some of us.

Debugging made easier with local project and doesn't need to pay money for debuggers!
